Java library to upload an Excel Worksheet to a database.
It is intended to make moving business worksheets to a MySQL database easier, by creating an initial populated MySQL table.

Due to Excel-MySQL type mapping, the MySQL table data types will most likely be sub-optimal, so it is recommended that the table created is either updated or used a temporary data source.
